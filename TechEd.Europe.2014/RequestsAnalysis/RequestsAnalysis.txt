Requests Analysis

1) Compile and upload files to blob storage
   From now on, will assume samples have been uploaded to these URLs:
   https://$clusterStorageAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/$clusterBinariesContainer/$mapperBinary
   https://$clusterStorageAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/$clusterBinariesContainer/$reducerBinary

2) Open Windows Azure PowerShell and set your Azure account.
   - Installation of Windows Azure PowerShell
     http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/install-configure-powershell/#Install
   - Verify you are using the correct account using the cmdlet:
     > Get-AzureAccount
   - If needed, set the correct account
     - Add an account using the cmdlet:
       > Add-AzureAccount 
	     Use get-help Add-AzureAccount for help
     - At times, cached credentials may cause errors, and those may be resolved removing and adding again an account.
       > Remove-AzureAcccount "[Your-AzureAccount-Alias]"
       > Add-AzureAccount

3) Customize variables in the config file and run ".ps1" script from Windows Azure PowerShell
   - If needed, change values for variables at the top of the script
   - Make sure the containers referenced in the script exist, mainly the input
     The output and status containers may be created, assuming the account has permissions
   - Run the script
     It will indicate the location for the output
	 Make sure running PowerShell scripts is enabled, as per this guidance:
