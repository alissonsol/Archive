# macOS M1 instructions

Shortcut to the many guides to install [requirements](./requirements.md) in the macOS.

Instructions under development for the Apple M1 machines. Steps being documented, as well as what doesn't work yet.

## Steps that may need manual interaction

Steps that may need a password or other decisions before proceeding. First, install Brew (may need password and press to continue).

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

*M1* May need to manually add brew to the path:

```shell
echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /Users/[alias]/.zprofile
eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
```

Now, install mkcert and then install the root certificates. May need to enter password twice when running `mkcert -install`.

```shell
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
```

PowerShell may also need the password. Install also the module for Yaml.

*M1* Install Rosetta 2 first with: `sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta`

```shell
brew install --cask powershell
pwsh
Install-Module -Name powershell-yaml
```

If not installed yet, install and configure Git.

```shell
brew install git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your@email.address"
```

Install Docker.

*M1* Not working yet. References:

- Status of the [Support for Apple silicon processors](https://docs.docker.com/go/apple-silicon)
- Instructions to install the [Apple M1 Tech Preview](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/)

Start Docker from the `Applications` folder. Then, open the settings panel and [enable Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes).

*M1* Kubernetes won't start (see documentation for the M1 Tech Preview).

## Steps without manual interaction

These steps can then be executed to install Terraform, Helm and optionally Visual Studio Code and GraphViz (if you want to visualize Terraform plans).

```shell
brew install â€”build-from-source terraform
brew install helm
brew install graphviz
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

After installing Visual Studio Code, it is recommended to install the externsions for [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) and [Kubernetes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools).

## Blocking the path

Kubernetes not starting on Docker.

Terraform steps not working because the providers are not available.

```shell
Error: Incompatible provider version

Provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v3.0.0 does not have a package
available for your current platform, darwin_arm64.
```
